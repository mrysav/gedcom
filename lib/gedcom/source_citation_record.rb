#  The data provided in the <<SOURCE_CITATION>> structure is source-related information specific
#  to the data being cited. (See GEDCOM examples starting on page 57.) Systems that do not use
#  SOURCE_RECORDS must use the second SOURce citation structure option. When systems which
#  support SOURCE_RECORD structures encounter source citations which do not contain pointers to
#  source records, that system will need to create a SOURCE_RECORD and store the
#  <SOURCE_DESCRIPTION> information found in the non-structured source citation in either the
#  title area of that SOURCE_RECORD, or if the title field is not large enough, place a "(See Notes)"
#  text in the title area, and place the unstructured source description in the source record's note field.
#
#  The information intended to be placed in the citation structure includes:
#  * A pointer to the SOURCE_RECORD, which contains a more general description of the source.
#  * Information, such as a page number, on how to find the cited data within the source.
#  * Actual text from the source that was used in making assertions, for example a date phrase as
#    actually recorded or an applicable sentence from a letter, would be appropriate.
#  * Data that allows an assessment of the relative value of one source over another for making the
#    recorded assertions (primary or secondary source, etc.). Data needed for this assessment is how
#    much time from the asserted fact and when the source event was recorded, what type of event
#    was cited, and what was the role of this person in the cited event.
#    - Date when the entry was recorded in source document, ".SOUR.DATA.DATE."
#    - Event that initiated the recording, ".SOUR.EVEN."
#    - Role of this person in the event, ".SOUR.EVEN.ROLE".
#
#The attributes are all arrays representing all the +1 TAGS/Records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in the SOUR records.
