#Internal representation of the GEDCOM ASSO record types.

#A relationship between an Individual_record and one of the other level 0
#record types, as defined by the TYPE tag. The default being another 
#a relationship with another Individual_record.

#
#  An indicator of the record type being pointed to or used. For example if in an ASSOciation, an
#  INDIvidual record were to be ASSOciated with a FAM record then:
#    0 INDI
#      1 ASSO @F1@
#        2 TYPE FAM /* ASSOCIATION is with a FAM record.
#        2 RELA Witness at marriage
#
#==RELATION_IS_DESCRIPTOR:= {Size=1:25}
#  A word or phrase that states object 1's relation is object 2. For example you would read the following
#  as "Joe Jacob's great grandson is the submitter pointed to by the @XREF:SUBM@":
#     0 INDI
#       1 NAME Joe /Jacob/
#       1 ASSO @<XREF:SUBM>@
#        2 TYPE SUBM
#        2 RELA great grandson
