=== 0.9.4 / 2015-11-19

* Stopped using Hoe for deployment
* Cleaned up syntax errors

=== 0.9.3 / 2013-01-10

* transcription of code from original C source base.
* Bug fix to GEDCOMBase.xref_check, which didn't qualify index lookup when printing an error message.
* Added Transmission.self_check, which calls new FamilyRecord.self_check and IndividualRecord.self_check
  Checks the gedcom file FAMC, FAMS, HUSB, WIFE, CHIL and SUBM xrefs resolve to valid records.
  Required adding IndividualRecord.child? and IndividualRecord.spouse? for tests.
  Fixed bug in IndividualRecord.spouses and IndividualRecord.parents_family as neither worked and were used by tests.
* Removed 'require chart.rb' which was left in production code by mistake
* Added in the GEDCOM 5.5.1 Draft changes. Most changes are alternatives to the 5.5 standard, but the Multimedia record
  File and Format structure is different, so these are now classes, rather than attributes.
