#  The FAMily record is used to record marriages, common law marriages, and family unions caused by
#  two people becoming the parents of a child (i.e they may not be married). There can be no more 
#  than one HUSB/father and one WIFE/mother listed in each FAM_RECORD. We are recording parentage,
#  rather than marriages per se. If, for example, a man participated in more than one
#  family union (or with more than 1 wife) then he would appear in more than one FAM_RECORD. The 
#  family record structure assumes that the HUSB/father is male and WIFE/mother is female. Again,
#  as we are recording parentage, and we can't yet clone or reproduce from two males. or from two females.
#
#  The preferred order of the CHILdren pointers within a FAMily structure is chronological by birth.
#
#The attributes are all arrays for the level +1 tags/records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in this record.
