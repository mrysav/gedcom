#Internal representation of a reference to a GEDCOM NOTE_STRUCTURE, or reference to a Level 0 NOTE.
#NOTE types can be inline, references to Level 0 NOTEs, or used to store user defined tags. 
#All NOTES are stored in the Note_record closs and referenced through this class.
#
#=NOTE_STRUCTURE:=
#  n NOTE @<XREF:NOTE>@       {1:1}
#    +1 <<SOURCE_CITATION>>   {0:M}
#
# The inline NOTE, also described as a NOTE_STRUCTURE in the GEDCOM standard, is stored in a Note_record.
#
#The attributes are all arrays for the level +1 tags/records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in this record.
