#
#  The EVEN tag in this structure is for recording general events or attributes that are not shown in the
#  above <<INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>>. The general event or attribute type is declared
#  by using a subordinate TYPE tag to show what event or attribute is recorded. For example, a
#  candidate for state senate in the 1952 election could be recorded:
#    1 EVEN
#      2 TYPE Election
#      2 DATE 07 NOV 1952
#      2 NOTE Candidate for State Senate.
#
#  The TYPE tag is also optionally used to modify the basic understanding of its superior event and is
#  usually provided by the user. For example:
#    1 ORDN
#      2 TYPE Deacon
#
#  The presence of a DATE tag and/or PLACe tag makes the assertion of when and/or where the event
#  took place, and therefore that the event did happen. The absence of both of these tags require a
#  Y(es) value on the parent TAG line to assert that the event happened. Using this convention protects
#  GEDCOM processors which may remove (prune) lines that have no value and no subordinate lines.
#  It also allows a note or source to be attached to the event context without implying that the event
#  occurred.
#
#  It is not proper to use a N(o) value with an event tag to infer that it did not happen. Inferring that an
#  event did not occur would require a different tag. A symbol such as using an exclamation mark (!)
#  preceding an event tag to indicate an event is known not to have happened may be defined in the future.

#  Where:
#    >::         greater than indicated age
#    <::         less than indicated age
#    y::         a label indicating years
#    m::         a label indicating months
#    d::         a label indicating days
#    YY::        number of full years
#    MM::        number of months
#    DDD::       number of days
#    CHILD::     age < 8 years
#    INFANT::    age < 1 year
#    STILLBORN:: died just prior, at, or near birth, 0 years
#
#  A number that indicates the age in years, months, and days that the principal was at the time of the
#  associated event. Any labels must come after their corresponding number, for example; 4y 8m 10d.
#
#==EVENT_DESCRIPTOR:=                                           {Size=1:90}
#  A descriptor that should be used whenever the EVEN tag is used to define the event being cited. For
#  example, if the event was a purchase of a residence, the EVEN tag would be followed by a
#  subordinate TYPE tag with the value "Purchased Residence." Using this descriptor with any of the
#  other defined event tags basically classifies the basic definition of the associated tag but does not
#  change its basic process. The form of using the TYPE tag with defined event tags has not been used
#  by very many products. The MARR tag could be subordinated with a TYPE tag and
#  EVENT_DESCRIPTOR value of Common Law. Other possible descriptor values might include
#  "Childbirth-unmarried," "Common Law," or "Tribal Custom," for example. The event descriptor
#  should use the same word or phrase and in the same language, when possible, as was used by the
#  recorder of the event. Systems that display data from the GEDCOM form should be able to display the
#  descriptor value in their screen or printed output.
#
#==RESPONSIBLE_AGENCY:=                                         {Size=1:120}
#  The organization, institution, corporation, person, or other entity that has authority or control
#  interests in the associated context. For example, an employer of a person of an associated occupation,
#  or a church that administered rites or events, or an organization responsible for creating and/or
#  archiving records.
#
#==CAUSE_OF_EVENT:=                                             {Size=1:90}
#  Used in special cases to record the reasons which precipitated an event. Normally this will be used
#  subordinate to a death event to show cause of death, such as might be listed on a death certificate.
#
#The attributes are all arrays for the level +1 tags/records. 
#* Those ending in _ref are GEDCOM XREF index keys
#* Those ending in _record are array of classes of that type.
#* The remainder are arrays of attributes that could be present in this record.
